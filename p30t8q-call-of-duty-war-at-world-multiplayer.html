Hi Guys so I decided to play call of duty world at war multiplayer which I had from about 4 months and I didn't actually play multiplayer,but when I open it,it says retrieving profile account,and then create online profile,and when i write my name i press create and then it says you need to create online profile to play !! and then I press cancel it says "Cannot Connect To Online Service" and I press "ok" then it says "Unable To Initialize Punkbuster is disabled" and I press exit,then I press. I have not posted here in a while so some of you may not know who I am then again some of you may know. I navigate reddit through a screen reader, my phone reads visual elements as synthesized speech, writing this post with dictation instead of a keyboard since I cannot find my Bluetooth one For those who do not know me I have played Call of Duty since world at war and played mostly multiplayer with some zombies depending on the title, at the time of World at war to ghosts I had vision So, as the title states, I haven't played minecraft for 3 years straight. I remember back in 2014-2016, I used to play multiplayer and go to miniplex and hypixel a whole lot and play the games on those servers. It was fun, I loved it and played it every day after school, sometimes I would even spend all night playing until it was 1 to 2 in the morning. After I'd say 2 months of playing on hypixel, I met my best friend, let's call him Nick, or NickthePlayer321 as his username. As a Call of Duty Fanboy, I am hyped for the new release of MW4. I have played every CoD game released, and I have stuck with the franchise through highs and lows. That being said, this does not mean that I will just buy any willy-nilly game that they release, a game has to earn my purchase. Most of the CoD games released in past years have been plagued with overpriced DLC content, advanced movement, or lack of content available to the player. This is not what CoD is truly about, and I believe. Hello all, I've had a list of unclaimed Steam keys in my Humble account for a while, and I figured I'd spread the love a little. Most of these games are not great, but there are some very good ones here and there that I already had. So I don't know how these usually go (first time poster in this subreddit), but rules say I have to wait 12h before starting to choose winners. I have honestly no clue how to decide on who gets a game if many users request the same one. Any ideas?. Looking to offload a lot of stuff here - photos on request.

Hey everyone, Here's the very timely results to our GOTY voting held at the end of last year. I'm extremely sorry that it took me so long to get these finished, as well as for not creating our yearly GOTY infographic. My apologies, y'all.

Hey guys and gals, I'm 32 and when I was very young I had a Nintendo, but for some reason it was taken from me (I forget why, got in trouble for something when I was like 6) and I didn't play another game until I got a Nintendo 64 when I was about 12, and I remember I really liked Goldeneye 007, Donkey Kong, and Zelda. Fast forward to middle school and I loved Starcraft (but only played the campaign never multiplayer because our Internet suckes). But I never had another PC game, ever. After.
